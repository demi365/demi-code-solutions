/**
 * A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

 * Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array
 * contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

 * You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered
 * to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.
