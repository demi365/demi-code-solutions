# Demi's Coding Solutions
Leet code solutions organised in java as and when solved

Has solutions solved from,
1. Leetcode
2. Code Forces Div 2
3. Dev community

This is a organized leet code solution complied for the betterment of the community.
This will have a track of all the most solved and important solutions which are useful for reviewing.
As much as possible this will contain the most optimized solution, along with sufficient Java documentation along with it.

This helps us review the solutions on quick basis.

There are few annotations to look out for
1. `@Leetcode` -> This denotes which leet code problem number it denotes to and what is the difficulty of it. Currently only these, no tags are assoicated with this.
2. `@CodeForces` -> This denotes that the origin of this problem was from Code forces and is coming from a code forces div contest
3. `@CodeFactor` -> This denotes three variables
    1. space : The space complexity of the provided algorithm
    2. time  : The time complexity of the provided algorithm
    3. type  : The type of the problem, these are like tags created to track which tag it belongs to.
